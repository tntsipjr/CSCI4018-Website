    <h1>Origami</h1>
    <p>
        Origami is the Japanese art of paper folding. In modern usage, the word
        "origami" is often used as an inclusive term for all folding practices,
        regardless of their culture of origin. The goal is to transform a flat
        square sheet of paper into a finished sculpture through folding and sculpting
        techniques. Modern origami practitioners generally discourage the use of cuts,
        glue, or markings on the paper. Origami folders often use the Japanese word
        kirigami to refer to designs which use cuts.
